# Layoffs Data Cleaning (SQL)

This project showcases my data cleaning process using SQL on a dataset about global layoffs. The objective was to standardize, clean, and prepare the data for analysis.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- MySQL
- SQL (Window functions, CTEs, data transformation)

---

## 📋 Key Tasks Performed

- ✅ Removed duplicate records using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...)`
- ✅ Standardized textual data (e.g., trimming company names, unifying industry labels like "Crypto")
- ✅ Transformed string-formatted dates to proper `DATE` datatype
- ✅ Replaced blank values with NULLs and populated missing values using self joins
- ✅ Deleted irrelevant records with fully missing key metrics
- ✅ Dropped unnecessary columns (`row_num`)

## 🗃️ Sample Schema Used

```sql
USE world_layoffs;

CREATE TABLE layoffs (...); -- Original table not modified
CREATE TABLE layoffs_working LIKE layoffs; -- Working table
CREATE TABLE layoffs_working2 AS ...; -- Final cleaned dataset
