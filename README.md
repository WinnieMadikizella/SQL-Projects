# SQL-Projects
Welcome to the **SQL Projects** section of my portfolio.  
This folder showcases data analysis, cleaning, modeling, and exploratory projects built using SQL in **SQL Server** and **MySQL** environments. These projects reflect my ability to write optimized queries, structure data effectively, and extract meaningful insights from raw datasets.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies  
- **Data Modeling:** Creating normalized schemas, star/snowflake designs, and relationships  
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Uncovering trends, KPIs, and business insights with SQL  
- **Advanced Querying:** Joins, window functions, CTEs, subqueries, aggregations  
- **Database Management:** Working with relational databases (MySQL, SQL Server)  
- **Performance Tuning:** Writing efficient queries for large datasets
